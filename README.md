# FOMOSv3-Blue v3 - Novusk v3-beta a v3.1.1

A [Novusk](https://github.com/new-kernel/novusk) based OS

### Project history

[FOMOSv1-Yellow](https://github.com/NathanMcMillan54/FOMOSv1-Yellow) (Free, Open source, Mobile, Operating, System) 
<u>was</u> a UI for mobile devices, Linux would start a Js UI that someone would use. Eventually I wanted it to turn 
into a full OS, and it will one day with Novusk.

This is an OS that can run on whatever you want it to. Laptops, PCs, microcontrollers 
(with lots of specific attachments).
